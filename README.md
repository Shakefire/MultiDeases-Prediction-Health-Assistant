# Design and Implementation of a Multi-Disease Diagnostic Tool with Explainable Outputs and Personalized Health Reports

# ABSTRACT
The integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare has revolutionized early disease
detection and risk assessment. This paper presents an AI-Powered Multi-Disease Prediction System
capable of simultaneously evaluating risks for diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s, breast cancer,
and liver disorders. The system combines machine learning models with an interactive Streamlit-
based interface, offering real-time predictions, explainable AI insights through SHAP values, and
automated PDF reports with personalized health recommendations. Built upon ensemble learning
techniques and disease-specific classifiers, the system achieves robust performance, with an average
accuracy of 89.2% across all supported conditions. A key innovation lies in its patient-centric design,
which incorporates gamification elements to encourage user engagement and adherence to
preventive measures. The framework emphasizes transparency through feature impact analysis and
addresses clinical practicality by generating actionable reports that guide follow-up care.
Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance, particularly for diabetes and breast
cancer, with F1-scores of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. The system’s modular architecture allows
seamless integration of new diseases while maintaining privacy through local execution. This work
advances the field of clinical decision support systems by bridging the gap between multi-disease AI
models and real-world healthcare workflows. Future extensions may incorporate federated learning
for collaborative model improvement across institutions.
